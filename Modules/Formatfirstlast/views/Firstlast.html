    Music is an art form, social activity or cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements</p>
<p>The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being music", including Beethoven's Grosse Fuge in 1825[2] and early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s.[3] There are many types of music, including popular music, traditional music, art music, music written for religious ceremonies and work songs such as chanteys.</p>
<p>In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in religious rituals, ceremonies (e.g., graduation), social activities (e.g., dancing) and cultural activities ranging from amateur karaoke singing to playing in a funk band or singing in a choir. Common sayings such as "the harmony of the spheres" and "it is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no noise, only sound.</p>
<p>People may make music as a hobby, for example in a youth orchestra, or as a professional musician or singer. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies.</p>
